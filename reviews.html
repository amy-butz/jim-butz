    <p>"Two performances shine brilliantly. Jim Butz is utterly, profoundly real as Astrov. The immersive format lets us see in intimate detail the workings of this astonishing actor."<br>

    <p>"Still, Astrov, passionately played by Jim Butz, is enthralling as he commands everyone’s attention taking the soapbox with his prognostications of the fate of the hosting family..."<br>

    <p>"Butz is powerful in the role, whether as the ruling king, a warrior on the battlefield, a leader pumping up his troops, or a man wooing a princess without the benefit of a shared 
    common language. There are scenes that Butz breathes a new vibrancy and life into upon his entrance, lifting the scene to a higher artistic level."<br>

    <p>"There's really no doubt about it: For the next couple weeks Jim Butz is the hardest working actor in St. Louis.
        As young Hal in Shakespeare's Henry IV, Butz strides aside equally billed players, where his transformation 
        from irresponsible drunkard to king is but one of several competing narratives. In the title role in Shakespeare 
        Festival St. Louis' Henry V, however, the transformation is complete: Butz takes center stage, and — as Henry would France — owns it."<br>

    <p>"As young Michael and narrator, Jim Butz exudes the reverence and innocence Friel has so expertly captured in his script. There's an unaffected lilt to Michael's voice that's present throughout the story, and Butz complements it with a wistful dreaminess in posture and expression as he voices his younger self. Butz and director Gary Barker ensure Michael never enters the scene with his family, but the actor is physically, emotionally, and mentally present in each moment."<br>

    <p>"You can thank Nancy Bell for the rich Irish dialects, notably Michael’s as spoken by Jim Butz.

This is truly an ensemble effort, with each of the players showing her or his ability to integrate artistic energy into an ingratiating performance. Butz sets the tone of the work with his forlorn countenance as he recalls the last happy moments of the Mundy brood, but also is delightful as Michael the lad, squealing excitedly in conversations with the adults"<br>

    <p>"Jim Butz is awkwardly kind and hesitant as Mr. Marks, his eyes filled with genuine emotion when he looks at Esther. A man as devoted to his faith as he is to the artistry and beauty of fabric 
        and the clothier's craft, Butz matches Thompson in temperament and both share a quiet depth. His reactions are at times nearly imperceptible, yet perfectly measured and drawn."<br>

        <br>
    <p>"Pay particular attention to Butz’ Mr. Marks, with incredible body language in his portrayal, miniscule gestures and timing that show us what he’s thinking – or perhaps deciding what not to think."<br>

        <p>"Jim Butz's Hamlet is clear-voiced and speaks said language with a remarkable fluency; this is a gift not to be taken lightly, especially if you're not sitting in the first ten rows. Even at the back of Shakespeare Glen where the actor's faces are indistinguishable, Butz conveys Hamlet's moral and intellectual quandary through his musical voice. Rage, despair, uncertainty, a sense of amazement and more come through his delivery — there isn't a bad seat in the house for this performance."<br>

        <br>
        <p>"Lithe and self-assured, Butz makes a prince in the romantic tradition, a heartbreaker whose heart is broken from the very first scene."<br>
           <a class="review-links" href="http://www.stltoday.com/entertainment/arts-and-theatre/reviews/festival-s-hamlet-is-a-gem/article_468b8b59-139b-50b3-b7d9-baa36b4a74e3.html" target="_blank">

        <p>"The three leads — Jason Cannon, Jennifer Theby and Jim Butz — do marvelous work. . . And it is Jim Butz who created the white space in my notebook. Angelo's nature is limned in frosty tones and an impossibly
straight posture, a veritable ray of justice. But as he slips further morally, the line of his back is broken, first subtly, then violently
as he becomes that rough beast who slouches over Isabella and smells her hair in a profoundly horrid scene."<br>

    <br>
        <p>"Jim Butz (brother of Tony-winner Norbert Leo Butz) is excellent as three clones of the son of a guilt-stricken father (Anderson Matthews). Each grapples with questions of identity in five "coming-out-of-the-test-tube" 
        scenes. And Mr. Matthews is quite strong in a role that Rep audiences will find extremely familiar by now.
The sense of deja vu for both actors is unavoidable. Happily, there are many worse things than twenty or more charismatic Jim Butz's wandering the planet: he's panicked, menacing and dear in his various Xeroxed incarnations 
in A Number. Ms. Churchill's script gives him lots of intricate thought-mazes to get lost in, in the style of Beckett or Pinter (though without the pauses, of course)."<br>

    <p>"Butz has the showier "three faces of Eve" role. In one scene he personifies innocent confusion; in the next he emanates Neanderthal terror. "Look in my eyes," the bullying son instructs his father. "Keep looking." We should all keep peering into Butz's eyes, because that's where the evening's labyrinthine changes can be charted. Initially they are perplexed and inquiring; next they become as lethal as grenades; soon they will be as bright as the blue socks one of the sons likes to wear."<br>

    <p>"As Mark Antony, Jim Butz breathes fresh life into familiar speeches. All the actors speak the meter precisely (accenting the final syllable in words like "glanced" or "transformed" when required by poetic law); Butz manages to make it sound natural.

Butz's kick-ass delivery of Antony's crowd-stirring speech jump starts the second half of the play. . ."<br>
